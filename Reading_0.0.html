        Welcome to AI City! In this course, we will create a virtual city which leverages AI technology
        for its futuristic infrastructure.

        During this course, you will:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Program cars to navigate throughout the city autonomously, including using computer vision
                techniques to read in-simulation traffic directions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Utilize powerful natural language processing (NLP) techniques paired with evolutionary
                algorithms to optimize the layout of the city.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use sophisticated probabilistic techniques to predict activity of certain types of agents
                in the city.<br>

                <sub>*With applications in quantum computing</sub>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        We are Aaron and Ashwin, both studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, in our final year
        here at UCLA. We are invested in making this course educational and enjoyable, with the goal of setting
        you guys up for success.
    </p>

    <p>
        We want everyone in this class to have a project they are proud of by the end of
        the quarter, while providing enough content so that those who are interested may push the limits and learn
        new ideas all quarter.
